## Getting Started

#### 1. Clone and setup:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pratyushmaini/pokepurge.git
cd pokemon-purge-challenge
conda create -n pokepurge python=3.12 -y
conda activate pokepurge
bash setup.sh
```

#### 2. Get a sense of the code base by running the following commands:
```bash
python main.py --red NoAttackTeam --blue NoDefenseTeam --prompt "A pikachu in the wild"
python main.py --red BaseAttackTeam --blue BaseDefenseTeam --prompt "A pikachu in the wild"
python main.py --red BaseAttackTeam --blue BaseDefenseTeam --prompt "A cute yellow mouse"
python main.py --red BaseAttackTeam --blue BaseDefenseTeam --prompt "A cute yellow electric mouse with lightning tail and blush cheeks"
```
These three examples will run the base attack and defense teams on the given prompts. The second and fourth prompt should be filtered out. The 1st, 3rd prompt should be generated, but the 3rd would not resemble a Pikachu.


#### 3. Implement your strategy:
- Blue Team: Enhance methods in `methods/`
- Red Team: Implement attacks in `attacks/`
- Add your team to `registry.py`
- Both: Maintain model performance above threshold so that it can still perform well on held-out tasks

#### 4. Submit:
- Fork repository
- Add your implementation
- Document approach in README
- Each team can submit upto 5 entries in the `registry` as Red Team, and 1 entry in `registry` as Blue Team.
- Submit pull request

## Defense

### Input Filters
We use the basic regex filter provided in the implementation.

We also created a perplexity filter to screen for prompts that are most likely adversarial. Optimized prompts like ours 
use sequences of tokens that often have high perplexity and low fluency. We created a perplexity filter using GPT2 to calculate perplexity and lightGBM as a classifier to detect prompts like these and to censor them. We have a high threshold for perplexity
to decrease the likelihood of false positives.

### Model Modification
Our main defense involves model editing done by adapting the implementation of the paper [Unified Concept Editing in Diffusion Models](https://github.com/rohitgandikota/unified-concept-editing) to our diffusion model. This implementation entails specifying
concepts to erase and concepts to preserve -- so we tried to edit out the forbidden pokemon while still preserving the model's
performance on nonforbidden pokemon. The approach entails editing the model's cross attention weights without fine-tuning, using a closed form solution to the simultaneous minimization of the difference between new outputs and old, conditioned on the concepts to 
preserve and the concepts to forget. 

We uploaded the new model's weights to huggingface. We also provide some our our implementation of the approach in the `model modifications.py` file.

We found that this approach completely erases the concepts of the forbidden pokemon in all of our testing.

### Output filters
We chose not to use the base filter, or to use a resnet-based image classification model that we trained, due to the possibilty of 
False Positives. We found that this occured an uncomfortable amount of times in our testing. Instead, we trust in the performance of our model modification to not produce the forbidden pokemon 

## Attacks

### pezAttack

This attack substitutes prompts containing a forbidden pokemon's name with a pre-generated prompt optimized with the PEZ method
specifically designed to generate that pokemon.

We generated images of all forbidden pokemon with the stable diffusion model. For each image, we optimized an 8-token prompt with 
the PEZ method, from paper [Hard Prompts Made Easy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03668). We had to slightly modify the original [implementation](https://github.com/YuxinWenRick/hard-prompts-made-easy) to work with the text encoder system used by our stable
diffusion model. We also tuned the hyperparameters to generate better prompts. We ran the optimization system for 10000 steps, and 
took the prompt with the highest similarity score to the generated image. All prompts achieved at least 40% similarity, which is similar to the pez performance documented in the paper [Prompt Recovery for Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06502). 

We found that pez prompts do not always generate images completely faithful to the meaning of the original prompt, but they do not 
contain the names of the forbidden pokemon so it is unlikely they will be detected by an input filter.

### MMA-Diffusion Text-Modal Attack
Given that the diffusion model’s denoising steps are guided by the text embedding, MMA-Diffusion launches an attack by ensuring identical latent from text encoder, guaranteed by their proposed semantic similarity-driven loss. To find such a free-style adversarial prompt, the paper uses a search method based on gradient optimization. Then, sensitive word regularization is applied to ensure that generated prompt does not contain any sensitive words. Thus, MMA-Diffusion maintains high fidelity of the output without any sensitive words.
The paper can be found here: [MMA-Diffusion: MultiModal Attack on Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.17516#page=3.49) and we used the code available [here](https://github.com/GunjanDhanuka/mma-pokepurge) with modified target prompt and fewer iterations (about 150 per prompt v/s the recommened 500+).

This attack ensures that we can evade an input filter, and now to evade any output filter we had to generate images that looked like a Pokemon to human, but could deceive models like CLIP. Upon manual experimentation, we found that using art styles like Cubism or making hybrid of Transformers+Pokemon was effective at bypassing CLIP-based output filters. Hence we used Claude-3.5 Sonnet to generate target prompts for each pokemon, also adding context like type of pokemon and its body features to compensate for the loss of information by prompt optimization.

### SimilarTextEmbeddingAttack

This naive attack substitutes forbidden pokemon names with a random number of tokens that have similar *sentence* embeddings 
as the original names. Since they do not contain forbidden names, it is unlikely they will be detected by an input filter.

We generated these by searching over the vocabulary space of the embedding model, generating text embeddings, and keeping the tokens
with the highest similarity scores with respect to the forbidden name's embedding. This was a naive way to find prompts that are close in the text embedding space to the original prompt, but to evade input filters. If we had more time, we would build 
longer token strings iteratively, using a more sophisticated search method.

This is a similar approach to PEZ, but it ranks generated prompts based on text embedding similarity rather than image-text embedding similarity.

### SynonymReplacementAttack

This attack is built off of the base implmentation and replaces the names of forbidden pokemon with short descriptive phrases meant
to evoke the character. It is designed to evade input filters.
